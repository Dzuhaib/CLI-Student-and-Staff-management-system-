**Interactive CLI Program with TypeScript and Inquirer**

This repository contains a TypeScript program that demonstrates an interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) application using the Inquirer library. The program simulates a simple interaction between a user and a system managing students and staff.

**Features:**
**Classes and Objects:** Utilizes TypeScript classes (Student, Person) to manage student data.<br>
**Interactive CLI:** Uses Inquirer to prompt users with selectable options and input prompts.<br>
**Dynamic List Management:** Allows users to add new students dynamically and view the current list of students.
Graceful Exit: Provides an option to exit the program gracefully using the CLI.
